The Loch Ness Pipers

Welcome to my first Code Institute project, The Loch Ness Pipers. The website has been created in order to create an online presence and awareness for a fictional event bagpiper business based in the Highlands of Scotland. With an array of different pipers, the website aims to promote and showcase the variety of pipers and services offered with a primary goal of leading potential customers to make their first initial contact with the business through the contact page.


## Demo

# Features
### Existing Features
This is where existing will go

### Features to implement in the future
**Testimony Page**
 - Once the business has started trading and undertaken events, we will add a testimony page to showcase the positive customer experience and feedback
 
 **Online availability / booking system**
 - This will help potential customers to further check the suitability of the business by showcasing if any pipers are available for their event date. This will also allow customers to book their chosen day and chosen piper for their event.

 **Media Page**
 - Once the business has started trading and undertaken events, a media page will be created hosting both photos and videos of pipers performing and showcase their skills and abilities.
